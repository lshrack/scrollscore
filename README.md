ScrollScore V0 is a proof-of-concept implementation of a tool that automatically scrolls PDF sheet music based on microphone input.

How to run ScrollScore:
1. Install requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt. Using a Python virtual environment is strongly recommended.
2. Install a working version of FFmpeg for your system, if you don't already have one: https://ffmpeg.org/
3. In the main directory for the project, run python app.py to launch the tool.
4. The tool should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload, where you can upload a PDF for conversion.
